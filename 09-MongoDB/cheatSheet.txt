1. Working with database

Create db or switch db = use 'dbname'
list all db = show db
show current db = db
delete = db.dropDatabase()

2. Working with collections : 

show collections = show collections
creating a collection = db.createCollection('<name>')
drop a particular colection = db.<name>.drop()

3.Working with Rows:

show all the Rows = db.<collection name>.find()
insert one row = db.<collection name>.insert([{'object':1},
'object':2])
delete a row = db.<collection name>.remove({object:value})
